   logged into radar, and moved to another directory if and only if there is 
   an unresolved file

   expects the original best and single filenames to exist.

CHANGES: Initial commit TR7493 
  Gene Traps Less Filling
Known issues:
1) sequence references are not being associated to the allele
2) SEQ_GeneTrap.goodHitCount is not being set
3) needs updates for the most recent schema changes
4) test run using TIGM only with mocked up TIGM info
    a) one parent cell line "Lex 3.13"
    b) parent cell Line Translation from "TIGM Gene Trap Library Lex 3.13 victr75" to "Lex 3.13"
    c) Two TIGM vector name terms "victr75" and "victr76" 
    d) Two Derivations, one for each vector 
	"TIGM Gene Trap Library Lex 3.13 victr75"
	"TIGM Gene Trap Library Lex 3.13 victr76"
5) Also the following vocabs are mocked up and added each time I load my test db:
    a) lab code vocab term (labname) and abbreviation (lab code)
	CMHD    CMHD
	EGTC    EGTC
	ESDB    ESDB
	FHCRC   FHCRC
	GGTC    GGTC
	Lexicon Genetics        Lex
	TIGEM   TIGEM
	TIGM    TIGM
	SIGTR   SIGTR
    b) translation from dbGSS raw creator to above vocab
